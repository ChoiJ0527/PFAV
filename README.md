## A Path Finding Algorithm Visualization Tool
![image](./docs/gbf_example.png)


This project visualize how different path finding algorithm find the path from the starting point to end point, using `tiny graphics` libarary.

Currently, we have two path finding algorithms implemented\
* Depth first search (DFS)
* Greedy best first



# Initial Setup
1. Download [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Setup a fake server to run locally:\
`python3 ./server.py`\
Go to your browser\
It will be running at `localhost:8000`

# How to use 
![image](./docs/control_panel.png)

Beside all the button in the control panel, you can hover your mouse pointer to change starting and ending point (represented by a pointer and a ball respectively). You can also toggle walls by clicking on the highlighted grid.
